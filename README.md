# Voice-Based-Mood-Prediction-Model
Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts a user's mood based on their voice input. Utilizing advanced audio processing techniques and deep learning, the model can classify emotions from speech, providing insights into the speaker's emotional state.

Features
Real-Time Audio Processing: Records live audio input and processes it in real-time.
MFCC Feature Extraction: Extracts Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) from the audio data for effective emotion recognition.
LSTM Neural Network: Implements an LSTM-based model for classifying emotions, leveraging the temporal dependencies in speech.
User-Friendly Interface: Allows easy interaction with the model for live mood predictions.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, Librosa, SoundDevice, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib
Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook
How to Use
Clone the Repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voice-mood-prediction.git
Install Dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Notebook:
Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to train the model, record audio, and predict mood.
Model Performance
Achieved [mention accuracy, e.g., 85%] accuracy on the validation set.
The model is capable of identifying emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc.
Future Enhancements
Data Augmentation: Implement data augmentation techniques to improve model robustness.
Deployment: Deploy the model as a web application for broader accessibility.
Additional Features: Integrate more complex features like pitch, tempo, and energy to enhance prediction accuracy.
